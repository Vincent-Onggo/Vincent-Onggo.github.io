            <div class="overview-right">
                <p>As a Software Engineering Intern at LitUp Network, a subsidiary of OMS Group (a global, neutral, and integrated telecommunications infrastructure service provider), in Jakarta, I had the opportunity to work on real-world challenges in data visualization and remote infrastructure management. I developed a Tkinter-based application to streamline building management system (BMS) data analysis and played a key role in setting up a new cable landing station in Batam. Additionally, I contributed to cost-saving measures by setting up self-hosted RustDesk servers for secure, remote access to infrastructure across multiple sites.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="details-right">
                <p>Managing and visualizing large-scale BMS data efficiently was a major hurdle. With hundreds of parameters tracked over months, engineers needed a more intuitive way to interpret trends and insights. Additionally, ensuring secure remote access to BMS across different locations was crucial for seamless maintenance and monitoring.</p>

                <h2>My Approach</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="details-right">
                <p>To tackle these challenges, I developed a Tkinter-based tool that utilized Excel data input and Matplotlib for dynamic visualizations. This provided engineers with a clear and structured view of complex BMS data. Additionally, I set up self-hosted RustDesk servers to enable secure, remote desktop access to monitor and manage the infrastructure, significantly reducing the company's reliance on paid subscription services like TeamViewer.</p>

            <div class="details-right">
                <p>The project significantly improved LitUp’s operational efficiency. Engineers gained a more intuitive way to analyze BMS data, leading to faster decision-making. The self-hosted RustDesk solution provided secure remote access, allowing teams to troubleshoot and manage systems from anywhere without incurring subscription costs. My contributions also played a key role in the successful setup of the Batam cable landing station, furthering LitUp's mission to build reliable digital infrastructure in Indonesia.</p>

            <div class="details-right">
                <p>This experience reinforced the importance of adaptability, problem-solving, and effective communication. I honed my technical skills in Python, Tkinter, and RustDesk configuration while also learning how to navigate real-world project constraints. Collaborating with professionals across different teams gave me valuable insights into network management, data visualization, and the impact of well-designed tools on daily operations.</p>
