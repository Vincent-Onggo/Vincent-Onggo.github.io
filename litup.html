                <p>As a Software Engineering Intern at LitUp Network in Jakarta, Indonesia, I developed a Tkinter-based application to visualize building management system (BMS) data and assisted in setting up a new cable landing station in Batam. Additionally, I configured RustDesk servers for remote monitoring of BMS across multiple sites.</p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>Efficiently managing and visualizing complex data from building management systems (BMS) and monitoring host computers across geographically dispersed locations posed significant challenges. LitUp needed a reliable solution to handle the large data volumes for BMS and enable secure, remote access for effective monitoring and maintenance.</p>

            <div class="details-right">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>To address these issues, I developed a Tkinter-based application utilizing Excel sheets for data input and implemented advanced data visualization techniques with Matplotlib. This allowed for a streamlined view of 400+ BMS parameters across months of data. Additionally, I configured and maintained self-hosted RustDesk servers to monitor host computers across three sites in Indonesia, enhancing BMS monitoring capabilities and reliability.</p>

                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>The application and RustDesk server setup provided LitUp with greater control over its building management systems, with real-time insights and improved remote access. The cable landing station in Batam also benefited from these secure monitoring capabilities, contributing to LitUp's mission of delivering state-of-the-art solutions across Indonesia.</p>

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>This internship offered practical experience in data visualization, remote monitoring, and infrastructure setup. Working with Tkinter, Matplotlib, and Pandas strengthened my understanding of data manipulation and visualization in a BMS context, while the RustDesk configuration deepened my skills in secure network management.</p>
