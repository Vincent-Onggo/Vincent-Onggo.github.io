                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Autonomous driving continues to be one of the most significant challenges in transportation technology. Our research team set out to develop a flexible and scalable testbed, aimed at advancing self-driving capabilities while addressing the complex challenges of transitioning algorithms from simulation to real-world environments. The challenge was not just building an autonomous vehicle but ensuring that it could handle real-world driving scenarios while improving on existing reinforcement learning models.</p>

                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <p>The F1-Tenth platform provided a flexible foundation for developing advanced control strategies. My work centered on designing custom controllers for tasks like driving straight and implementing a PID-based wall-following system, enabling the vehicle to navigate autonomously. I focused on sim-to-real adjustments to align simulation with real-world performance, solving issues like steering instability by dynamically modifying the steering angle to correct oscillations.</p> <p>I fine-tuned the PID control parameters to improve wall-following precision, ensuring smooth navigation. Additionally, I used VESC software to enhance motor control, achieving refined acceleration. Setting up and calibrating a depth perception camera enabled the vehicle to capture crucial environmental data and supported real-time monitoring through live video streaming. These efforts advanced the vehicle's performance and reliability in both simulation and real-world testing.</p>
