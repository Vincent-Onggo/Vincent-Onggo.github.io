                <p>Autonomous vehicles are changing the future of transportation, and my journey with the F1-Tenth project was all about making those advancements more accessible. As part of a multidisciplinary team, I helped develop an experimental testbed that bridged the gap between theory and real-world implementation. My focus? Taking self-driving technology from simulation to reality—building control systems, refining algorithms, and troubleshooting hardware/software integration to push the boundaries of what these small-scale autonomous vehicles could do.</p>

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Developing self-driving technology isn’t just about making a car move on its own—it’s about making it move intelligently, safely, and reliably. Our team set out to create a flexible, scalable testbed to develop and test control algorithms. The toughest part? Ensuring that what worked in simulation also performed well in the real world. From handling sensor noise to stabilizing control responses, I faced complex challenges that required creative problem-solving, persistence, and a willingness to iterate.</p>

                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <p>My role focused on designing and refining control strategies. I developed custom controllers for basic maneuvers like straight-line driving and implemented a PID-based wall-following system to enhance autonomous navigation. One of the biggest challenges was adapting simulation-based designs to work in real-world environments. By fine-tuning PID parameters and dynamically adjusting steering angles, I improved stability and reduced oscillations.</p>
                <p>Beyond algorithms, I worked hands-on with hardware, setting up and calibrating a depth perception camera to improve environmental awareness. I also optimized motor control using VESC software, which enhanced acceleration and made the vehicle’s movement smoother. Throughout this process, I relied not just on technical knowledge but also on teamwork, adaptability, and troubleshooting skills to get things working seamlessly.</p>

                <h2>The Results</h2>
                <p>This project was about more than just building an autonomous car—it was about developing a robust platform for future research and innovation. The testbed we created allowed for iterative experimentation, making it easier to test and improve control algorithms in a real-world setting. My work on control strategies contributed to smoother, more reliable autonomous navigation, while the integration of software and hardware helped bridge the sim-to-real gap.</p>
                <p>More than the technical results, this experience reinforced the importance of collaboration and adaptability. Working alongside other researchers and engineers taught me how to communicate complex ideas effectively, troubleshoot under pressure, and continuously refine my approach based on feedback and testing.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest takeaways from this project was the critical role of iteration and adaptability in engineering. Simulation is a powerful tool, but real-world execution requires constant adjustments and problem-solving. I learned to embrace debugging as part of the process, not a setback.</p>
                <p>Beyond technical skills, I honed my ability to collaborate in a fast-paced research environment. Balancing individual problem-solving with team-based brainstorming was key to overcoming challenges efficiently. Most importantly, this project reaffirmed my passion for working at the intersection of robotics, software, and AI—areas where innovation can directly impact real-world applications.</p>
