                <p>During the pandemic, reducing contact with commonly touched surfaces became crucial for minimizing the risk of infection. Door handles, being high-contact points, presented a significant challenge. Traditional sanitization methods, such as wiping or spraying alcohol, are often forgotten or can cause long-term damage to the door handles. UVinci’s automatic UV sanitizer addresses this issue by using UV-C rays to sanitize door handles automatically whenever motion is detected by a Pyroelectric Infrared Sensor (PIR).</p>

                <h2>User Problem</h2>
                <p>Commonly touched surfaces like door handles are prime areas for virus and bacteria transmission. Traditional sanitization methods are often unreliable, forgotten, or require harsh chemicals that can degrade the materials over time. There was a need for a more consistent and sustainable solution to ensure public safety, especially in high-contact areas.</p>

                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="details-right">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>UVinci’s automatic UV-C sanitizer device uses a PIR sensor to detect motion and activate the sanitization process. It sanitizes the door handle with UV-C light, powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Controlled by an Attiny-13a-PU microcontroller, the device operates with a time delay for optimal performance. The design includes a 3D-printed casing that houses a UV shield mechanism and a detachable latch for easy recharging.</p>

                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>The UVinci prototype has been successfully implemented in Ngaduman Village, Java, where access to healthcare is limited. It’s installed on public door handles in spaces like schools and churches, helping to create safer environments. Additionally, fundraising efforts via Bantoo.id have raised 9.5 million rupiahs, enabling progress toward large-scale manufacturing of the device.</p>

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>This project reinforced the importance of user-centered design in developing impactful public health solutions. It also taught me about the challenges of turning an idea into a tangible product, particularly through the development and fundraising process. The experience deepened my understanding of product management and how critical innovation is in addressing real-world health challenges.</p>
