                <p>During the pandemic, preventing contact with commonly touched surfaces is crucial to avoid infection. Door handles, being one of the most touched surfaces, pose a significant risk. Traditional cleaning methods, such as wiping or spraying with alcohol, are often forgotten or can damage door handles over time. UVinci’s sanitizer device addresses this problem by automatically sanitizing door handles using UV-C rays when its Pyroelectric Infrared Sensor (PIR) detects motion.</p>

                <h2>User Problem</h2>
                <p>Commonly touched surfaces, especially door handles, are critical points for virus and bacteria transmission. Traditional sanitization methods can be easily forgotten, leading to potential health risks. Moreover, frequent exposure to harsh chemicals can damage door handles over time, necessitating a more reliable solution.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>UVinci’s sanitizer device automatically sanitizes door handles with UV-C light upon detecting motion through a PIR sensor. Powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and controlled by an Attiny-13a-PU microcontroller, the device operates with a time delay for optimal performance. The 3D-printed casing includes a shield mechanism to contain UV light and a detachable latch system for easy recharging.</p>

                <p>The prototype is fully functional and has been implemented in Ngaduman Village, Java, where healthcare access is limited. The device is installed on door handles in public spaces like schools and churches, contributing to safer environments. Fundraising efforts through Bantoo.id have successfully raised 9.5 million rupiahs to facilitate larger scale manufacturing.</p>
